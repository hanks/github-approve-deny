![icon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hanks/github-approve-deny/master/github-approve-deny.png)
## What is this?  
A simple Google Chrome extension.  It adds Approve and Deny buttons to GitHub pull requests and parses pull request comments for Approve/Deny text.  

This repo is a trival modification version for the origin [one](https://github.com/cisox/github-approve-deny).  

## Why do I fork this?
Because I use Firefox as the default browser, not Chrome, but my teammates all use Chrome with this extension, So I need to write down '+1 Approve' every time when I approve a pull request, So to make my work easier, I modify this extension to support '+1' too.  

## Features
1. Both support '+1' and '+1 Approve' parses.
2. Clear comment text after pressing Approve/Deny button.
